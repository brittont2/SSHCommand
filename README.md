# SSHCommand
Python class to execute commands through ssh client
This was derived from a SANS SEC 595, I thought the code would be good to save for future use
Code Created by David Hoeltzer of SANS SEC595: Data Analytics and Machine Learning


To use instantiate the class

sshcommand = SSHCommand()

sshcommand.execute('<code goes here>')

ex. sshcommand.execute('ls')
